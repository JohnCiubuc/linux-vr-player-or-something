linux-vr-player-or-something
----------------------------

Very simple VR video player using libmpv and openhmd. Should function more or
less like mpv, just with VR support.

Doesn't do anything right, e. g. ignores the aberration shaders etc. from
openhmd, and the code is a mess.

But it plays videos.

Fixes welcome.


Dependencies:
    - mpv
    - openhmd
    - qt
    - c++ compiler
